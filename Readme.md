Sift for 
Classification 
Sibling identification 
Segmentation 
Live webcam keypoint matching
=======
Our project will be mainly based on SIFT and how it can be used in multiple ways. Main Target problems will be 
1.  **SIFT for visual classification** : Using bag of visual words classfication technique on CIFAR 10 dataset if possible or a subset of CIFAR10. 
2. **SIFT for adversarial Detection** : Using SIFT to detect if the input image is adversarially attacked or not. 
3. **SIFT for 3d Reconstruction** of monuments using uncaliberated stereo. 
4. **SIFT for Fingerprint matching** ([dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing)) 
5. **SIFT for live webcam matching** 

> Note: Save the bag of visual works to be reused again and again.

## Final Deliverables : 
- iPYNB for each of the 4 tasks, pushed to github repo.
- PY file for each of the task with a function which takes image as input and returns the output.
- Python  DASH application for the entire project.
- Report will in LATEX.
